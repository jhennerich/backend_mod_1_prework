# Pre-Teaching Practice

**CAREFULLY READ ALL THE INSTRUCTIONS BEFORE STARTING THESE EXERCISES!**

To start this assignment:

1. Click the button in the upper right-hand corner that says Fork. This is now your copy of the document.
1. Click the Edit button when you're ready to start adding your answers.
1. To save your work, click the green button in the bottom right-hand corner. You can always come back and re-edit your gist.

You will be practicing pre-teaching yourself some content based on actual lessons you will be working with at Turing. There are a few things to understand about pre-teaching:

- Pre-teaching is not designed to make you an expert about a topic before you learn it
- Pre-teaching will allow you to dedicate more focus in your lessons to areas that are unclear or confusing
- Taking some basic notes prior to a lesson will allow you to focus more on the content and less on "keeping up"
- Writing questions you have ahead of time will ensure that any areas of confusion are addressed in class

For this exercise, you will be pre-teaching yourself the first technical lesson you'll receive at Turing!
- [BE: Variables, Methods and Return Values](https://backend.turing.io/module1/lessons/methods_and_return_values)
- [FE: Data Types, Variables, Conditionals](https://frontend.turing.io/lessons/module-1/js-data-types-variables.html)

### Your Task

- [x] Acquire a notebook to take hand written notes in
- [x] Setup a Table of Contents in your notebook
- [x] Add photo of your Table of Contents in the Deliverables section
- [x] Read through the lesson and take some notes in your notebook
- [x] Add a picture of one page of your notes in the Deliverables section
- [x] Write down 3-5 questions you have about the content in the lesson or questions related to the content and add to the Deliverables section
- [x] Identify 1-2 resources OUTSIDE OF TURING that you can use to clarify any of the content in the lesson and add to the Deliverables section

A few tips for taking notes ahead of time:
- You don't need to write down every single word from the lesson - try to get down the main points in an outline form, key phrases/explanations, etc. This process will take time to figure out!
- Give yourself enough room to add notes later during class - you'll often need space to add context, create visuals, and make connections to other content during a lesson
- Consider using different colors to help organize your notes or highlight syntax

`Write 3-5 questions you have after pre-reading this lesson here`

- What is good ruby programing practice concerning return.  Should I use explicit returns in the majority of methods?
- When you define multiple arguments in a method and only pass in one, what are the others set to? Are the nil or does an error get thrown?
- Does Ruby have reserved names that you can't use for your own variables?

`Add links to 1-2 resources from OUTSIDE OF TURING that relate to this lesson`
- [ruby-doc.org](https://ruby-doc.org/core-3.0.2/Method.html)
- [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ruby-types-of-variables/)

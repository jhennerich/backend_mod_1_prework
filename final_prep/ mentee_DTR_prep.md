### Mentee Details
1. `What is your preferred name?`

3. `What did you do before Turing?`
-  I worked for USWEST/Qwest/CenturyLink for 20 years supporting the Voice Messaging platform as a system admin and provided tier2 support for the RX repair tool which repair call agents used to troubleshoot customer issues. For the last few years I was a project manager for the CenturyLink repair tool https://serviceassistance.centurylink.com/

4. `What made you decide to come to Turing?`
- I have been in the operations and maintenance side of application support my whole career.  I know from my last few years with CenturyLink I do not like project management.

5. `What are you most excited about exploring in your career in tech?`
- I am looking forward to being on the development side of the house vs the production and maintenance side.

# Reflections:
### Unconscious Bias at Work — Making the Unconscious Conscious

+ What were your reflections from the video?

   Until watching this video I had not heard of the term unconscious bias.  The concept of most if not all your assumptions are questionable was a bit surprising as was the idea that you can access something by looking at it is most times incorrect.  I like to think my life experience, background and education would have eliminated bias but this is not the case.  Even with identifying unconscious bias does not solve the issue.

+ In what ways have you examined your implicit biases before coming to Turing?

  Prior to watching the video and reading the article I was not aware of implicit biases, thus I had not examined them.

+ What kind of software do you imagine building in the future? How will understanding biases (or avoiding understanding biases) impact your products?

  I am hopeful that I will be able to create software which can automate manual mundane human tasks which can free people to do more creative and interesting tasks.  By identifying bias I can be mindful that maybe people enjoy doing simple tasks and might not want them to be automated.  What I might think is good to eliminate others might disagree with.


### “All of us live complex lives that require a great deal of juggling for survival,” Carty and Mohanty said in an email. “What that means is that we are actually living at the intersections of overlapping systems of privilege and oppression.”

  + When you consider the way you move through the world, what elements of your identity are you most aware of on a daily basis?

    I am aware that I am a white adult man, and believe that I am non-threatening and unremarkable.  I try to be positive, kind and friendly towards those I interact with.

  + What strengths does your identity give you? How will you utilize those at Turing?

    I feel that I will do well in team projects and team building.  I have always enjoyed working in groups and meeting new people.    

  + How do you think you could value the identities of those around you to bring out their strengths at Turing? Has there been a time where you were able to advocate or include people around you?

    I will do my best to relate to and understand the background and experiences of other classmates and instructors.

  + How will your strengths impact you as a teammate? What will you bring to your cohort?  

    I try to find the best out of every situation.  This attitude allows me not to get bogged down by obstacles and helps me keep moving toward problem resolutions. Hopefully I can share this with my classmates and project partners.
